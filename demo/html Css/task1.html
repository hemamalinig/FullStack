    <p>
        <b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b> was born on <i>23 January 1897 (at 12.10 pm)</i> in <big>Cuttack</big>, Orissa
        Division, Bengal Province, to
        <big>Prabhavati Devi</big> and <big>Janakinath Bose</big>, an advocate belonging to a <small>Kayastha
            family</small>.He was the ninth in a family of
        14 children. Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India,
        but whose attempt during <b>World War II</b> to rid India of British rule with the help of <u>Germany</u> and
        <u>Imperial
            Japan</u> left a troubled legacy. The <b>honorific Netaji</b> <mark>(Hindustani: "Respected Leader")</mark>,
        first applied in early 1942
        to Bose in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the <sub>Indische Legion </sub> and by the German and Indian
        officials in the
        Special Bureau for India in <sub>Berlin</sub>, was later used throughout India.Bose had been a leader of the
        younger,
        radical, wing of the <sup>Indian National Congress</sup>.Bose arrived in Germany in <strike>March 1928</strike>
        April 1941, where the
        leadership offered unexpected, if sometimes ambivalent, sympathy for the cause of India's independence,
        contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities.

    <tt>With Japanese support, Subhas Chandra Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), then composed of Indian
        soldiers of the British Indian army who had been captured in the Battle of Singapore</tt>

    <p>
        To these, after Bose's arrival, were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese had
        come to support a number of <del>illiterate puppets and provisional governments in the captured regions, such
            as</del>
        those in Burma, the Philippines and Manchukuo. Before long the Provisional Government of Free India, presided by
        Bose, was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands. <br>
        The Indian National Congress, <del>>the main instrument of Indian nationalism</del>, <ins>praised Bose's
            patriotism but distanced
            itself from his tactics and ideology</ins>,especially his collaboration with fascism.The British Raj, though
        never
        seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually
        backtracked in the face both of popular sentiment and of its own end.
